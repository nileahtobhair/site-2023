I've wanted to do a "what I've read this year" book list since I read Stephen King's a few years ago. Likely slightly incomplete owing to both having taking this notion to compile it at the beginning in September but also due to my outrageously bad memory for book and author names. In no particular order, the list is as follows:

Maeve's Times - Maeve Binchy
The good life - Jay McInerney
Daisy Jones and the Six - Taylor Jenkins Reid
