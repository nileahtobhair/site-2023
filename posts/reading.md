I love to read. It's one of my favourite hobbies. For the first time ever, I set myself a goal to read 100 books in 2024. If accomplished, this will likely be the most books I've ever read in a calendar year. I've never kept track before to know definitively. I was previously of the opinion that setting reading goals was taking the fun out of it. While I still believe that may be true, I don't think there's much harm in a little goal setting.

To keep myself somewhat accountable, I'm committing to listing my read books here with a very short review, as well as a rating out of 5.

<br/>

## Shoe dog - Phil Knight - 4/5\*

Tells the story of the origins of Nike. Very engaging read, makes you foolish enough to consider starting your own company a good idea.

## The Post Office - Charles Bukowski - 4.5/5\*

The first book in a series of fictionalised books about his life, the Post Office is a must read if you're a Bukowski fan. A great first read if you're interested in becoming a Bukowski fan.

## The Shining - Stephen King - 3.5/5\*

Not my favourite Stephen King book, I found it difficult to get through. However, I thought the book to be a better story than the movie adaptation. Well written, but I found the pace of the story to be disjointed. Stephen King is a masetro though, who I am to judge.

## Boy Parts - Eliza Clark - 3.5/5\*

I was expecting great things with this book, as it has strong reviews elsewhere. I was dissapointed however, I found the main character unhinged and unlikeable. Overall I felt it a very one dimensional protrayal of female rage.

## My year of rest and relaxation - Ottessa Moshfegh - 4.5/5\*

Loved this book. Another unlikeable protagonist, but very well written. Enjoyed the slow pace of the book and the sudden ending.

## Alices Adventures In Wonderland - Lewis Carroll - 4/5\*

I read this book as a kind and really hated it. I didn't like how discombobulated Alice's perspective was and how it was hard to get a firm grasp of the storyline. Reading it as an adult is a different experience. Hard not to appreciate Carroll's imagination, his poetry and overall craft.

## Klara and the Sun - Kazuo Ishiguro - 4.5/5\*

Loved this, one of my favourites. Beautiful, gentil. Scifi but with hazy world building. Looking forward to reading his other works.
