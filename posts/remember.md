## About

I am building remember remember, which is a simple app to view and save important dates. The idea is a build a standalone space, separate from clustered calendar apps so users can easily access the dates they deem important.

The idea was initially inspired by my desire to get rid of my facebook account. My main heistation in doing so was the photos but also the birthdays I had saved on there. Naturally I could manually download the photos, and add all dates saved to a calendar app. With the funcionality and UI of calendar apps however, I don't believe that I will get the same date functionality that I currently use FB for.

Later I was also inspired by the f1 specific [calendar](https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2024.html), which allows fans to see all the races for a single season. Again, anyone can just add the f1 calendar to their own general calendar app but I really think this standalone context related calendar has its use.

## Tech

The front-end is built using react, (initially bootstrapped using create-react-app), javascript and scss modules. For front-end data storage, I have built a simple storage store leveraging react context.

It is currently managed and deployed using netlify.

The BE api is built using nestJS, typscript and mySQL.

## Status

A simple FE only working prototype is available at the link in the table above. I am currently working on building out the API and will soon have the full stack MVP available to start getting users into the product.

I have built a marketing page (also linked in table above) but have yet to do anything to drive users to it. The idea here is to slowly invite users in after initial rounds of external user testing have completed.
