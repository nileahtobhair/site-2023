In May 2023, I quit my job to travel full time. Intentionally quitting without
another job lined up, I imagined I would travel for a while before looking at getting back into work sometime in the late summer. I didn't do that. I spent time wandering around SE Asia. I hit the summer and decided to keep on trucking. Headed to Australia. Got to watch the womens world cup. Went to the US, then Mexico. At Christmas, I headed back to my folks in Dublin. Made the decision to do a full year. April to April ish. Thought I'd talk about some of my thoughts having travelled.

## Freedom

There is something so wonderful about having no obligations to be anywhere. To wake up in the morning and have the availability to do anything. Go anywhere. Some parts of the world offer more flexibility
