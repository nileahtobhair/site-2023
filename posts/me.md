Because a CV or social media profile sometimes do little to convey the real character behind a person, here's some more info about what makes me me.

I grew up in the suburbs of North Dublin, Ireland. The middle child, with a quiet middle child personality. The second daughter. A mostly happy childhood. Likely the last generation to grow up without technology, we played outside all day and came home when the streetlights came on. One Christmas my dad came home with a family computer. One of those big white bricks that we kept in the dining room. With three kids in the house, there were fights over who's turn it was. Lots of soltaire, days of playing sims when the weather was bad. Later there was internet through a phone line and msn messagener, friends on bebo. But mostly, it was a childhood unencumbered by screentime.

I loved it, played every sport I could try. But mostly football. Played on the street, played at school, played on a girls team in a boys league until they kicked us out. Played in the wind. Played in the rain, and good lord how it does rain on that small patch of land tethered to the North Atlantic.

I liked school back then. Liked maths, enjoyed reading. Enjoyed puzzles and lego and the competition of it. Sucked at doing art and learning Irish but wish now I'd been better at both. I was good at taking direction and liked the adulation of being the good at something, making me a good candidate for teachers pet.

Thankfully, I grew out of it. Puberty came, and with it the love of school faded. Stopped engaging with academedia. Hung around with friends. Did all the things that school is good for that isn't school itself. Read books, lots of books. Waited years to for the last Harry Potter book to come out. Queued at midnight to get my hands on it. Read it in one day. Read the last chapter first.

Got my first job. Retail, customer service. Sometimes wonderful, sometimes hell on earth. The making of a person. The building blocks of character. More sports, watching, playing. Trips to landsdown road to witness the mens team lose. An entire year of being the worst basketball player the planet has ever seen.

A trip to New York with family. Wandering around dangerous parts of the city with my sister with no adult supervision. Before phones with internet that worked magically in other countries. Before our mother could find us. Her anger. Our apathy. The first tiny taste of true freedom.

Bought my first ipod touch that trip. Bloody loved it. Jailbroke it, customised it. Manually set the covers of all the illegaly downloaded music. Took it everywhere. Unknowingly began the journey of spending every day tied to a screen. Finished school, took my exams. Did what was needed and not much more. Glad in retrospect, some things are more important.

University. Chose computer science because it seemed apt. For the first time, difficulty. Concerted effort just to stay afloat. Unsettled and unsure. Still working in retail. Too many hours, in retrospect. But no student loans, the ying and yang of life. Study abroad. Terrible french but more freedom. Travel, adventure and the kind of friendship that comes from needing to rely on one another. Graduation then first career job. Permanent freedom, welcome to adulthood.
